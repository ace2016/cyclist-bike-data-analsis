## Cyclist Bike Share Data

This case-study is a capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional course offered by Coursera.

The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights to convert casual riders of the fictional Cyclist Bike-Share company into annual members and to provide Lily Moreno (director of marketing and my manager) with the findings from the data.

###comparison of members and causal users

```{r}
aggregate(remodified_data$ride_length,list(remodified_data$member_casual), FUN = mean)
aggregate(remodified_data$ride_length, list(remodified_data$member_casual), FUN = median)
aggregate(remodified_data$ride_length, list(remodified_data$member_casual), FUN = max)
aggregate(remodified_data$ride_length, list(remodified_data$member_casual), FUN = min)
```
